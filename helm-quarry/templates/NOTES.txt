Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}!

An essential part of setting up your dev environment is adding an entry to your /etc/hosts file.
Get the IP of minikube with:
minikube ip
Add this line to your /etc/hosts file:
<ip address> quarry.local

You can override any values you need in a file called dev-values.yaml.

If you create one, run:
helm -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} upgrade {{ .Release.Name }} helm-quarry/ -f dev-values.yaml
Happy hacking.
